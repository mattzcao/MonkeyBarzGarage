# MonkeyBarzGarage
Website that I designed for a self-service garage in Bossier City, LA. If you see a website similar to this, it was because we worked on this project together, but unfortunately, as soon as I finished writing the code for it, I was cut from the project with no credit :) so I'm reuploading my work here

Website designed for desktop, only the footer is mobile responsive.
